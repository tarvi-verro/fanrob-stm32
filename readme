This is a codebase that has grown out of hacking with the STM32 based nucleo
boards.

Most of what you find here has been written from scratch using the STM
documentation.

One of the more insane ideas used in this project is using C bitfields to
handle hardware registers. While it is not a reasonable thing to do as far as
the C standard goes, it works alright in practise with GCC, for the most part,
anyway.

The two projects that use this codebase are found in the subdirectories
cameraheater/ and watercooling/.


cameraheater/
-------------
Code in this subdirectory is for a processor that handles the monitoring of
battery voltages and temperatures. It also handles the adjustable camera lens
heating, necessary to avoid lens "sweat" as the environment temperature
changes.

This is based on an NUCLEO-L432KC board.

watercooling/
-------------
This concentrates code for a microprocessor that controls fan speeds and
monitors temperatures in a computer case.

The board used for this project is NUCLEO-L031K6.
